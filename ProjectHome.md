CoreDCI provides the underlying DCI functionality for the [WaxPHP framework](http://code.google.com/p/waxphp).

DCI stands for Data,Context, and Interaction.  It was conceived by Trygve Reenskaug and Jim Coplien as a means for separating the application logic from domain logic (ie: what the objects ARE from what the objects DO).  It allows for a more organized runtime object network that can yield a far more flexible application.

CoreDCI is designed as a PHP implementation of the DCI paradigm.  It provides the 3 objects necessary to use DCI, as well as an extremely simple example of the use of DCI.
